# Simple Markdown parser
Simple markdown parser and a server to run localhost a working interface to render it in real time
![preview](preview.png?raw=true)

This is a simple exercise to implement a markdown parser with some kind of UI
It is intended tu run as a webserver and provide the UI in the browser

This project is under development, be patient
I am not a designer so don't expect a fancy UI but if you want to help to make one you are welcome ;)

## Install
Make sure that you have the Golang ENV variables well set and type

	git clone https://github.com/misuher/markdown.git markdown
	cd markdown
	go run main.go

You must get the server listening in localhost:3000
